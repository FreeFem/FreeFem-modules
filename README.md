# FreeFem++ modules

FreeFem++ is a wonderful engine but a lot of work is required to construct simulation algorithms.
We believe the community would greatly benefit from having a list of validated algorithms.

We therefore would like to invite all researchers and engineers to share their modules in this repository.

The modules in this repository are all available in LGPL.
